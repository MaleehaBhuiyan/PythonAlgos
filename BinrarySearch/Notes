Binary Search: Given a list and a target, determine if the target is present in the list 


How can we solve this problem obviously?
    • Linear Search: We can loop through this list until we fidn the element or until we reach the end, meaning that the element was not found

Binary Search Approach:
    • Take advantage of the fact that the list is sorted (this must be the case)
    • Split the list in half 
    • Look at the middle element
        • Ask if the target element is greater than the middle element?
            If yes then we will be looking at the right half of the split list 
        • Ask if the target element is less than the middle element?
            If yes then we will be looking at the left half of the split list
